Hey!
I couldn't start posting about agile methodologies, software development, quality in general, testing and related topics from my day to day before introducing myself.

I'm Tiago GÃ³es, or just "GÃ³es", Brazilian, Software Quality Engineer since 2018, before that, I worked as Software Requirements Analyst for two years, completed IT technican course (2011-2013) and degree Analisis and software development in 2016. I like practicing sports (I did Taekwondo from 9 to 19 also biking, crossfit), learn new technologies, aaaaand quality engineering.

I decided to start this blog to give a little bit back to community compared to what I've learned from it so far. I always wanted to do it before (and I don't know why I didn't start), anyways, this blog will be a mix of content, tutorials, tips, life hacks and anything else I feel comfortable sharing.

I hope you enjoy it. ðŸ˜€
