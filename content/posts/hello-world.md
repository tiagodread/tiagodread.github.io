Hey!
I couldn't start posting about agile methodologies, software development, testing and quality in general and related topics from our day to day before introducing myself.

I'm Tiago GÃ³es, or just "GÃ³es", Brazilian, Software Quality Engineer since 2018, before that, I worked as Software Requirements Analyst for two years, completed IT technican course (2011-2013) and degree Analisis and software development in 2016. I like practicing sports (I did Taekwondo from 9 to 19), learn new technologies, aaaaand quality engineering.

I decided to start this blog to share more about my day to day work with the community, my experience with different contexts. I always wanted to it before (and I don't know why I didn't start), anyways, this blog will be a mix of content, starting with tutorials, tips, life haks and anything else I feel comfortable sharing.

I hope you enjoy it. ðŸ˜€
