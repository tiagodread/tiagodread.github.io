[{"content":"Introduction Writing about the role of QA in software development teams is crucial to understanding the evolution of the area and the importance of moving away from the old perception that QA is limited to only ‚Äútesting software‚Äù. This article aims to clarify the differences between the roles of Tester, QA (Quality Assurance) and QE (Quality Engineer) and challenges faced by a QA professional within a development team.\nDifferences between Tester, QA and QE Tester is the more traditional and general used term and is more directly associated with performing manual tests. This function focuses on identifying bugs or defects in software, often operating at the end of the development cycle. The tester checks the product\u0026rsquo;s compliance with the established requirements, but his performance is generally reactive ‚Äî he acts after the product or functionality has already been developed.\nQuality Assurance (QA) is the process through which the product is subjected during the software development phase, when this process is clear and predictable, it allows the specified minimum quality expectations to be met. The term QA is also generally used in the job market to refer to professionals who work with software quality in teams. Calling a quality professional a quality assurance gives the impression that he is solely responsible for the quality of the product in general, and he is not!\n‚ÄúQA‚Äù (profession) expands the scope of action compared to a tester, focusing on the dissemination of good practices and ensuring that the development process is attended to by everyone from the beginning of the development cycle. More than finding defects, QA is involved in the planning, design, implementation and maintenance of processes that ensure product quality. This includes defining acceptance criteria, developing test cases and scenarios, risk mapping, development, automated testing, etc. The goal is to prevent defects to produce high-quality software.\nCool Tiago and Thamyres, if ‚ÄúQA‚Äù is not a profession, what should a professional who works with quality be called? Firstly, the professional needs to understand how software is designed, so that it is possible to define quality standards, understanding software engineering is a fundamental requirement for this, I am not saying that he needs to have completed a bachelor degree in the area, but yes, understand various aspects that will serve as a basis for your actions. Therefore, if a quality professional needs to know about software engineering, why not call him Software Quality Engineer, or Software Quality Engineer? As well, other areas have evolved over the years, Backend Engineer and Frontend Engineer, for example. When referring to a quality professional as ‚ÄúQuality Engineer‚Äù, it reinforces the idea to the market that this professional is also a software engineer, therefore, able to contribute to ‚Äúmore technical‚Äù activities such as defining testable architecture, code review, test automation at different layers, quick wins bug resolution, CI/CD, in addition to in-depth analysis of complex quality issues.\nConclusion With that, I hope it has become a little clearer about the differences between Tester, QA (quality assurance process), QA (market profession) and QE (software engineer who works with a focus on quality). It is worth mentioning that this is a reading that we do based on our perception and experience in the area over the years in several different companies and teams, mentoring software quality professionals in different seniority and contexts. Other professionals who are references in software quality in the market also share this vision, such as Elias Nogueira on the podcast Quality Assurance (QA) vs Quality Engineer (QE) and Og Maciel in Quality Engineering (QE)\nBy: Tiago G√≥es and Thamyres Moraes\n","permalink":"https://tiagodread.github.io/en/posts/quality-engineering/","summary":"Introduction Writing about the role of QA in software development teams is crucial to understanding the evolution of the area and the importance of moving away from the old perception that QA is limited to only ‚Äútesting software‚Äù.

No. Quality Engineer!"},{"content":"Much is said about diversity and inclusion nowdays; this is not a subject to be considered \u0026ldquo;a plus\u0026rdquo; within companies and in society in general, but rather essential for us as individuals to grow as human beings.\nWith all the discussion on the labor market about the importance of the theme, I came to draw attention to the hiring process of companies. So, how can we think of diversity and pluralism if the \u0026ldquo;doors are closed\u0026rdquo; even in the hiring process? In other words, the process itself is not inclusive.\nHow can we design a hiring process that is not auto-exclusive, which means without any bias and impartiality about gender, race, political, psychological, or mental conditions, respecting people\u0026rsquo;s indiduality?\nCurrently, much is said about diversity in companies and in the job market, but are we prepared to interview people without any of these biases?\nQuestions like: Do you consider yourself a fast learner? We need a person \u0026ldquo;like this or that\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; They are automatically exclusive to people with ADHD or any other similar limitation, for example.\nThere is a very fine line between visibly being \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo;. People like Linus Torvalds, for example, had no physical or mental limitations (as far as I know); however, he had an introverted personality and an aversion to formalities, but that did not stop him from creating and maintaining the kernel of Linux, one of the most important operating systems in the world to this day. Would he pass half of the recruitment and selection processes at companies today if he weren\u0026rsquo;t this well-known personality?\nI bring this reflection here because I recently started to structure the process of recruiting and selecting QEs at the company that I\u0026rsquo;m working for, and I realized that this does not only apply to QEs but to any type of hiring, as I could see when I reflected a lot on the subject.\nAnd you? What have you been doing to make the recruitment and selection process more inclusive in the context in which you are today? Finally, is it possible to achieve diversity within companies without stopping and reflecting on these and many other points?\n","permalink":"https://tiagodread.github.io/en/posts/on-the-fallacy-of-diversity-and-plurality/","summary":"Much is said about diversity and inclusion nowdays; this is not a subject to be considered \u0026ldquo;a plus\u0026rdquo; within companies and in society in general, but rather essential for us as individuals to grow as human beings.\nWith all the discussion on the labor market about the importance of the theme, I came to draw attention to the hiring process of companies.
