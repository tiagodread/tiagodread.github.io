      <description>Introduction Writing about the role of QA in software development teams is crucial to understanding the evolution of the area and the importance of moving away from the old perception that QA is limited to only “testing software”.

Differences between Tester, QA and QE Tester is the more traditional and general used term and is more directly associated with performing manual tests.</description>
