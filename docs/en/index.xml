      <description>&lt;p&gt;In software projects, especially those with longer timelines and higher complexity in business rules and/or changes, it&amp;rsquo;s common to require a better structured test plan to provide visibility over the scope of changes, business rules, and what will be tested. In many cases, one person on the team is responsible for executing all scenarios and documenting bugs. However, this is a great opportunity for QA to foster collaboration among team members, promoting knowledge sharing about a specific feature and strengthening the team’s quality culture and the feeling that &amp;ldquo;Quality is everyone’s responsibility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>QA? No. Quality Engineer!</title>
      <link>https://tiagodread.github.io/en/posts/qa-no-quality-engineer/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Writing about the role of QA in software development teams is crucial to understanding the evolution of the area and the importance of moving away from the old perception that QA is limited to only “testing software”. This article aims to clarify the differences between the roles of Tester, QA (Quality Assurance) and QE (Quality Engineer) and challenges faced by a QA professional within a development team.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;differences-between-tester-qa-and-qe&#34;&gt;Differences between Tester, QA and QE&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tester&lt;/strong&gt; is the more traditional and general used term and is more directly associated with performing manual tests. This function focuses on identifying bugs or defects in software, often operating at the end of the development cycle. The tester checks the product&amp;rsquo;s compliance with the established requirements, but his performance is generally reactive — he acts after the product or functionality has already been developed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the fallacy of diversity and plurality of thought in the labor market</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Much is said about diversity and inclusion nowdays; this is not a subject to be considered &amp;ldquo;a plus&amp;rdquo; within companies and in society in general, but rather essential for us as individuals to grow as human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all the discussion on the labor market about the importance of the theme, I came to draw attention to the hiring process of companies. So, how can we think of diversity and pluralism if the &amp;ldquo;doors are closed&amp;rdquo; even in the hiring process? In other words, the process itself is &lt;strong&gt;not inclusive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
