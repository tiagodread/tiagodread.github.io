      <description>Much is said about diversity and inclusion nowdays; this is not a subject to be considered &amp;ldquo;a plus&amp;rdquo; within companies and in society in general, but rather essential for us as individuals to grow as human beings.
With all the discussion on the labor market about the importance of the theme, I came to draw attention to the hiring process of companies. So, how can we think of diversity and pluralism if the &amp;ldquo;doors are closed&amp;rdquo; even in the hiring process?</description>
