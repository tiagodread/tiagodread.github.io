      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing about the role of QA in software development teams is crucial to understanding the evolution of the area and the importance of moving away from the old perception that QA is limited to only “testing software”. This article aims to clarify the differences between the roles of Tester, QA (Quality Assurance) and QE (Quality Engineer) and challenges faced by a QA professional within a development team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tester&lt;/strong&gt; is the more traditional and general used term and is more directly associated with performing manual tests. This function focuses on identifying bugs or defects in software, often operating at the end of the development cycle. The tester checks the product&amp;rsquo;s compliance with the established requirements, but his performance is generally reactive — he acts after the product or functionality has already been developed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
