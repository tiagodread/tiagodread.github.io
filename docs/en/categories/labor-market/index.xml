      <description>&lt;p&gt;Much is said about diversity and inclusion nowdays; this is not a subject to be considered &amp;ldquo;a plus&amp;rdquo; within companies and in society in general, but rather essential for us as individuals to grow as human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all the discussion on the labor market about the importance of the theme, I came to draw attention to the hiring process of companies. So, how can we think of diversity and pluralism if the &amp;ldquo;doors are closed&amp;rdquo; even in the hiring process? In other words, the process itself is &lt;strong&gt;not inclusive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
